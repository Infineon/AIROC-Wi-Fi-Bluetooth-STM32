# Wi-Fi Connection Manager (WCM)

## What's included?

See the [README.md](./README.md) for a complete description of the Wi-Fi Connection Manager.

## Known issues

| Problem | Workaround |
| ------- | ---------- |
| The `cy_wcm_deinit` API does not bring down the network stack because the default underlying lwIP stack does not have an implementation for deinit. Therefore, the expectation is that `cy_wcm_init` and `cy_wcm_deinit` APIs should be invoked only once. | No workaround. Support will be added in a future release. |
| The `cy_wcm_connect_ap` API does not connect to AP if the MAC address is specified as a connection parameter.| No workaround. This issue will be fixed in future release. |
| IAR 9.30 toolchain throws build errors on Debug mode if the application explicitly includes the *iar_dlmalloc.h* file | Add `'--advance-heap'` to `LDFLAGS` in the application Makefile. |
