Helpful things for the reader:

First of all, everything in this library is about natural numbers, meaning
that all of them are positive. There's no concept of a negative number and
thus multiplication and division are always unsigned.
You can create a negative number by subtracting a bigger one from a smaller
one, but it is up to you to do something with it - you get a non-zero borrow
from the subtract routine, indicating that you got a negative number (in 2's
complement form), how you deal with it is your problem. As far as the rest of
the library is interested, the result is just a (very big) positive number.

Second, the library is thread-safe, i.e. there's no static data anywhere.
The price you pay for that is that thread-safe allocation of memory to hold
big numbers is your responsibility.

The background of the algorithms in this file can be found at various places.
Most notably, Chapter 14 of the Handbook of Applied Cryptography should be
consulted, as well as the paper titled High Speed RSA Implementation by Cetin
Kaya Koc, downloadable from the RSA website. Further bits and pieces can be
found in various research papers that can be dug up on the Internet. A book
on discrete maths is handy, if you want to dig a bit deeper into the modular
stuff.

Natural numbers are stored in arrays of 32-bit words, in big-endian order.
If k is an N-word long number, then it is stored in an array of k[N].
Then k[i] means the memory word at index i (as in C) but in comments k(i)
represents the i-th 32-bit digit of k. That is, k(i) == k[ N-i-1 ].
Algorithmic descriptions usually refer to the digits of k, the code
comments might refer to both, but the notation is used consistently.

In the comments 2^N means the N-th power of 2, as usual. However, n^-1 is
usually the multiplicative inverse of n (modulo m), that is the number so
that ( n * n^-1 ) % m == 1 where % is the modulo. Similarly, -n is not
the negative of n but its additive inverse (a positive integer) so that
( n + -n ) % m = 0. If n < m then the additive inverse is simply -n = m - n.
If n >= m, then you can use the fact that -n is the same as -(n mod m) and
n^-1 is the same as (n mod m)^-1, i.e. you can always reduce n to be less
than m before starting the calculations.The multiplicative inverse is hard to
calculate, the algorithmic complexity is that of calculating the GCD of the
two numbers (GCD: greatest common denominator).

Here's the maths that you need to work out what goes on:

Basics:

Z: set of all integer numbers
Z+: set of all positive integers, zero included

If p is a prime, then the numbers 0, 1, ..., p-2, p-1 and the arithmetic
operators modulo p form a Galois (i.e. finite) field, usually denoted Zp.
The additive identity element is 0, the multiplicative is 1. The operations
are all performed modulo p:

a + b   :   ( a + b ) mod p
a * b   :   ( a * b ) mod p
a - b   :   ( a + -b ) ) mod p
a / b   :   ( a * b^-1 ) mod p

The b^-1, the multiplicative inverse of b is not that easy to calculate but
it exists for all elements but 0 and can be calculated at the cost of a GCD
calculation. The additive inverse, -x also exists for each x. If x is 0, then
-x is 0 for all other values -x = p-x.

The mod operator has a few interesting features that should be noted:

( a + b ) mod x =  ( ( a mod x ) + ( b mod x ) ) mod x
( a * b ) mod x =  ( ( a mod x ) * ( b mod x ) ) mod x
a mod x = b mod x iff (a - b) = k * x where k is in Z.

The Euler totient function (denoted by capital phi) is interpreted on positive
integers and its value is the number of integers less than the function argument
that are relative primes to the argument. Formally:

PHI(x) = || { n | n < x & gcd(n,x) = 1 } ||

For example, PHI(10) = 3 because from the numbers 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 only
3, 7 and 9 are relative primes to 10.
If p is a prime, then PHI(p) = p-1 since p is relative prime to all n < p.
If e is 2N then PHI(e) = e/2 since all odd numbers are relative prime to e.
The 'relative prime' is also called co-prime. Instead of writing that "a
and b are reletive primes" often the gcd(a,b)=1 notation is used.

Fermat's Little Theorem tells you that:

If p is a prime then a^p mod p = a mod p

Its generalisation is the Euler theorem (one of many...):

If GCD( a,n ) = 1 then ( a^PHI(n) ) mod n = 1

All numbers can be written as:

n = q * x + r

where n, x is in Z, q is floor( n / x ) and r is n mod x.

The Montgomery n-residual form of a number x is

y = x * R^-1 mod n

where R^-1 is the multiplicative inverse of R mod n where R is a number so
that R = b^k and b^(k-1) < n < b^k (i.e. R is the smallest power of the base b
that is larger than n. Note that it only exists if n and b are relative primes.
If the modulus is odd, then R can be any even number.
Now the Montgomery multiplication calculates the Montgomery residual of the
multiplication result instead of the simple mod n residual. It does it faster
than a normal modulus could be calculated. Denote the Montgomery multiplication
with #, that is:

a # b = ( a * b * R^-1 ) mod n

Now introduce a transformation, denoted with ' such as

x' = ( x * R ) mod n

then of course

a' # b' = (a*b)'
a' # ( R mod n ) = a'
a' # 1  = a

It can be fairly easily proven that the Montgomery domain (i.e. the x' world)
using Montgomery multiplication and normal addition is equivalent to the
original Galois field with normal multimplication and addition.
Thus, we can do exponentiation inside the Montgomery domain using faster
multiplies if we 1) transform the original number into the Montgomery
domain at the cost of a normal multiply, 2) transform the result back at the
cost of a Montgomery multiply and 3) calculate a 32-bit number, needed for
the Montgomer multiply, at the cost of a single precision division.
In fact, you can transform everything into Montgomery, do all your work
there and transform only the final result back.

If the numbers and the modulus have k digits, then the classical modular
multiplication uses 2k^2 multiplications and k single precision divisions.
The Montgomery method uses 2k^2 + 2k multiplications and no divisions.
Basically, in our case, we trade a 64/32 division and possibly a long
subtraction (plus some algorithmic complexity) for two 32x32->64 multiplies.
The difference is small, mostly because the Sparc core does not have a HW
multiplier, but if you do a lot of multiplies, the accumulated time savings,
in absolute terms, can be substantial. When multiplying 1024 bit numbers,
(on the Leon core) the classical modular multiply finishes in about 195k
clocks while the Montgomery finishes in roughly 167k clocks (~15% faster).

It is not worth using Montgomery to actually multiply numbers. Where the
Montgomery multiply comes handy is when you keep multiplying the same few
numbers and you do not need the interim result, just the final one.
In that case the initial transformation into the Montgomery domain and
the transformation back is negligible compared to the savings you make
on the multiplies. The best known such situation is exponentiation.

Classical modular multiplication

Calculates the r = ( x * y ) % m value.
If y is not given, then calculates x % m, i.e. it does a modular reduction.

It does a reduction in every step, therefore it does not need extra storage.
The way it works is simple ('digit' here means a 32-bit word):

If x and y are n-digit numbers and they are both less than m, the modulus,
then you can do the following:

r <- 0
for i from n-1 downto 0 do
    r <- r * 2^32 + x * y(i)
    r <- r % m
done
return r

Of course the r must be two words longer than x, y and m (it can be proven that
you do not need anything more). Now the modulus calculation is the one that
we want to speed up, a division is fairly expensive operation. Multiplication
is a lot cheaper, so if we can guess the q = r / m value we can calculate the
modulus using the r % m = r - q * m equation. The way we can guess the quotient
is that we divide the upper 64 bits of r with the upper 32 bits of the modulus.
The result of the division is at most a 33-bit number (yes, it is 33, if you
divide 0xffffffffffffffff by 0x80000000 you get 0x1FFFFFFFF). Treating the 33rd
bit as special case, we can use the rest as 32-bit q. Of course, our estimate is
just an estimate, not the actual precise quotient. However, it can also be shown
that Q <= q <= Q + 2 where Q is the real and q is the estimated quotient.
Thus, we can modify the algorithm accordingly:

r <- 0
for i from n-1 downto 0 do
    r <- r * 2^32 + x * y(i)
    q <- (r(n),r(n-1)) / m(n-1)
    r <- r - m * q
    while r < 0 do
        r <- r + m
    done
done
return r

and we know that the inner loop executes at most 2 times. To assure that the
approximation of q is that good, one has to guarantee that the top bit of the
modulus is set. That can not always be guaranteed. However, it is always
possible to shift the modulus (and the top of 'r') up until the condition
is met. So we still do division, but we trade a long division for a long
multiply and a single precision division - a much cheaper solution overall.

If you look at the algoritms, you will realise that the size of 'x' is
irrelevant, therefore the restirction that 'x' is less than the modulus
can be dropped.

The 'x' multiplicand can be of any length, 'y' must be less than the modulus
and the same length as the modulus or shorter, 'r' must be as large as the
modulus.

If the second multiplicand, 'y' is a NULL pointer then the routine will do
a modular reduction of x. Reduction alone is about twice as fast as a multiply
with a proper y would be.

******************************************************************************
Montgomery multiplication

Calculates the r = ( x * y * R^-1 ) % m value, where ^-1 means the
multiplicative inverse modulo m. R here is implicitely set to be the
smallest power of 2^32 that can represent the modulus, i.e. using an
1024 bit modulus, then R is (2^32)^32 = 2^1024.

The parameter m' is -m^-1 mod (2^32), that is, the number for which it
holds true: ( ( 2^32 - m' ) * m ) % ( 2^32 ) == 1; note that even though
the modulus m is a big number, m' is only a 32 bit number. It can be
calculated fairly quickly (roughly the same time as a 32/32 SW division).

Note that the Montgomery multiplication is *NOT* the same as a simple
multiplication modulo m. The extra multiply with the R^-1 mod m tag
makes the result very different from an ordinary multiply. It is not
very useful on its own; you have to convert the multiplicands into the
Montgomery domain and then convert the result back. The former costs
you a normal multiply for each operand and the latter a Montgomery
multiply. Thus, it is obvious that a simple mul-mod can be done much
faster. So why bother then? Well, when you have to do a lot of muls in
succession (for example, during exponentiation) then it becomes a real
timesaver because all the way through you do not have to calculate the
modulo m values, as you transformed the problem from one modulus domain
into an other where certain properties hold.

The running time of this function is about 150*n^2 clocks, that is,
for a 1024 bit modulus it is about 4ms.

The article by Koc is probably the best description of the background into
the whole Montgomery domain business. The short description of the algorithm
(but not the math) is here. The notation used is that k(i) means the i-th
32-bit digit of the n-word value of k, k(0) being the least significant digit
and k(n-1) being the most significant digit. If the (i) is not applied to k,
then it means k in its entirety.

Let x and y be two n-word positive integers, smaller than the modulus.
Let m  be the n-word modulus that MUST be odd.
Let m' be the 32-bit value of -m^-1 mod 2^32.
Let n  be the number of words in each large number.
Let u  be a single word temporary storage
Let r  be the n-word result, r = ( x * y * R^-1 ) mod m.

To calculate r do the following:

r <- 0
for i from 0 to n-1 do
    u <- ( ( r(0) + x(i) * y(0) ) * m' ) % 2^32
    r <- ( r + x(i) * y + u * m ) >> 32
done
if r >= m then r <- r - m
return r

As you can see, the number of multiplications is actually more than it is
with a normal modular multiply (2n^2 + 2n versus 2n^2). However, the single
precision division and the whole mess with the reduction is gone. This gives
the Montgomery multiply a maybe 15% speed advantage when implemented on the
Leon core.

\return     void
\param[out] r   Pointer to the result
\param[in]  x   Pointer to one of the multiplicands
\param[in]  y   Pointer to the other multiplicand
\param[in]  m   Pointer to the modulus
\param[in]  t   The m' = -m^-1 mod 2^32 value

The result must be distinct (in memory) from the inputs x, y and m.
The 'x' multiplicand can be of any length, 'y' must be less than the modulus
but the same length as the modulus, 'r' must be as large as the modulus.

Arithmetic inverse of modular inverse for the fixed modulus 2^32

Calculates the m' = -m^-1 mod 2^32 value for a multiword number.

Note that for modulo 2^32 one only needs to look at the lowest significant
32 bits of the number, the higher order bits simply have no effect.
This algorithm is faster than the GCD method. It uses only basic single
precision arithmetic and a fixed number of iterations. The algorithm is
the following:

let x be a number of which we need the multiplicative inverse mod 2^32:

y = 1;

for i = 2 to 32 do
    if 2^(i-1) < ( x * y ) mod 2^i then
        y = y + 2^(i-1)
    endif
done
return y

It works by observing the the fact that in each step (x*y) mod 2^i = 1
is maintained. The actual code avoids the multiplication, since as y is
calculated, the multiplication result can also be calculated in a separate
variable. In addition, the returned value is the additive inverse of the
modular inverse, rather than the modular inverse itself.

Calculates R mod m

R is a number that is the smallest power of 2^32 that can store the modulus.
That is, if the modulus is say 0x123, then a single 32-bit word can store it
and thus R is 0x100000000 (i.e. 2^32).

If the top bit of the most significant word in the modulus is set, then
R mod m can be calculated trivially, by subtracting the modulus from R.
If the top bit is not set, however, one has to do real calculations, costing
a single-precision division and N single precision multiplications where N is
the length of the modulus (in words).

Multiplies two 32-bit unsigned numbers and returns the 64-bit result

The old version of gcc that we use is not smart enough to do a 32x32->64
mul when you ask for it. It extends the operands to 64 bit and calls the
64x64->64 multiply instead. Considering that the entire natural number
library relies on the performance of the 32x32->64 multiplication, it
seems like a good idea to speed it up as much as possible. The routine
below does it in about 48 clocks: 40 for the actual mul and a couple more
that the compiler generates as function wrapper.
