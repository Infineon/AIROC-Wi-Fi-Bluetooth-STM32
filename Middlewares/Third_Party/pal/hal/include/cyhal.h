/*******************************************************************************
* File Name: cyhal.h
*
* Description:
* Top-level HAL header file that can be referenced to pull in all relevant
* drivers for the current device architecture. Not all of these may be
* supported in the current target device. The implementation must provide a
* cyhal_hw_types.h and a cyhal_drivers.h file in the include path for this
* to depend on.
* The cyhal_hw_types.h file must provide the following:
*   1) definitions for each of the resource types consumed by the HAL driver
*      functions.
*   2) A CYHAL_ISR_PRIORITY_DEFAULT define for the default interrupt priority
*   3) A CYHAL_MAIN_FLASH_BASE define for the base address of flash memory
*   4) OPTIONAL: Implementation specific header files can be used by creating
*      a #define in cyhal_hw_types.h with a name of CYHAL_<DRIVER>_IMPL_HEADER
*      and the value being the name of the header file.  eg:
*      #define CYHAL_GPIO_IMPL_HEADER "cyhal_gpio_impl.h"
* The cyhal_drivers.h file must simply be a list of include directives to pull
* in the relevant driver header files.

 * \note Support for new drivers/functionality may be added without changing the version number, to
 * check for whether a specific driver is available, the CYHAL_DRIVER_AVAILABLE_X macros defined in
 * \ref group_hal_availability should be used.
