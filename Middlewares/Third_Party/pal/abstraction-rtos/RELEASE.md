# RTOS Abstraction Library
The RTOS Abstraction APIs allow middleware to be written to be RTOS aware, but not need to care about what the actual RTOS is.

### What's Included?
The this release of the RTOS Abstraction API includes support for the following:
* APIs for interacting with common RTOS Features including:
    * Threads
    * Mutexes
    * Semaphores
    * Timers
    * Queues
    * Events
* Implementations are provided for
    * FreeRTOS
    * RTX (CMSIS RTOS)
    * ThreadX

### What Changed?
#### v1.5.0
* Added additional parameter validation for ThreadX
#### v1.4.0
* Added new thread functions: cy_rtos_wait_thread_notification and cy_rtos_set_thread_notification
* Minor documentation updates for clarity
#### v1.3.1
* Fixed a couple bugs in the FreeRTOS port
#### v1.3.0
* Update to work with a wider range of MCUs

* Added support for non-recursive mutexes: cy_rtos_init_mutex2()
* Added default implementations for FreeRTOS vApplicationGetIdleTaskMemory, vApplicationGetTimerTaskMemory, and vApplicationSleep
* Added support for ThreadX
NOTE: The vApplicationSleep implementation for FreeRTOS depends on the psoc6hal 1.2.0 or later.
#### v1.1.0
* Fixed an issue with the FreeRTOS implementation where it would always allocate memory for the thread stack, even if a pre-allocated buffer was provided.
* Removed usage of assert() and replaced with CY_ASSERT()
#### v1.0.1
