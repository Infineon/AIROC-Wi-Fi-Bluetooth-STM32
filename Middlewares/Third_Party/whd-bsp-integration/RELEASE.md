# WiFi Host Driver Board Support Package Integration Release Notes
This library helps streamline the process of getting the WiFi Host Driver (WHD) setup and running with a Board Support Package (BSP) that includes a WLAN chip.

### What's Included?
* APIs for setting up the WHD interface with the BSP's SDIO interface.
* APIs for connecting WHD to LwIP/NetXDuo memory buffers (whd_buffer_funcs_t)
* Framework for connecting WHD to LwIP/NetXDuo network interface (whd_netif_funcs_t)

### What Changed?
#### v2.1.0
* Added support for dyanmically allocated NetX Duo packets to support WHD IOVARs with payloads larger than MTU.
* Added support for NetX Duo
* Made SDIO initialization more robust
#### v2.0.0
* Added support for different communication protocols (SDIO, SPI, DMA) between MCU and Radio
* Card initialization process improvements. Code now checks whether SDIO device supports 1.8V signaling, and, if it does, performs the actions needed in order to switch to 1.8V.
* Added support for overriding the default country code by defining CY_WIFI_COUNTRY to a value from whd_country_code_t.
* Added argument to cybsp_wifi_init_primary_extended() to set WHD initialization parameters
* SDIO frequency is increased to 50 MHz if High Speed Mode is supported
* Added support for HAL API v1 or v2
* Minimum required `wifi-host-driver` library version for this release - `2.0.0`
#### v1.2.0
* Fixed possible memory corruption issue introduced with changes from v1.1.0
#### v1.1.2
* Robustness update for WLAN initialization
#### v1.1.1
* Update network buffer allocation for improved performance
#### v1.1.0
* Fixed a memory leak when shutting down the WHD interface
* Minor code style cleanups
#### v1.0.2
* Minor update for documentation & branding
#### v1.0.1
* Fixed issue with a missing ;
#### v1.0.0
* Initial release
