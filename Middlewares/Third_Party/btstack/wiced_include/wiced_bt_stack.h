 * Bluetooth Management (BTM) Application Programming Interface
 *
 * The BTM consists of several management entities:
 *      1. Device Control - controls the local device
 *      2. Device Discovery - manages inquiries, discover database
 *      3. ACL Channels - manages ACL connections (BR/EDR and LE)
 *      4. SCO Channels - manages SCO connections
 *      5. Security - manages all security functionality
 *      6. Power Management - manages park, sniff, hold, etc.
