# WPA3 External supplicant library

## Overview

The WPA3 External Supplicant supports WPA3 SAE authentication using HnP (Hunting and Pecking Method) using RFC https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7664 and H2E ( Hash to Element Method)  using RFC https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve-10 and following 802.11 spec 2016.

The WPA3 External Supplicant consists of the following components:

- The WPA3 External Supplicant has WPA3 SAE finite state machine based on 802.11 spec 2016 "Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications".

- The WPA3 External supplicant has cyrptograhic library to support ECP Group 19 (NIST P-256 elliptic curve). The WPA3 External supplicant uses MBEDTLS API cyrptographic suite support to perform ECP curve NISTP256 operations of bignum and ECP point operations to compute the scalar and element for SAE authentication commit message and computes the shared secret which is used to send confirm message and verify peer confirm message.

- The WPA3 External supplicant implements constant time comparison, assignment etc and uses MBEDTLS API(s) to prevent leakage of security information to side channel attacks.

- The WPA3 External supplicant interface with WiFi-Host-Driver to set PMK, PMKID and WLAN F/W handles EAPOL key exchange to derive keys and connect to WPA3 Access point.

- Programming Language: C

## Integration Notes

- The WPA3 External supplicant library has been designed to work with ModusToolbox SDK.
