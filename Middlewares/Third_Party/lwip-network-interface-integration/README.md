# lwIP network interface integration library

## Overview

This library is an integration layer that links the lwIP network stack with the underlying Wi-Fi host driver (WHD) and Ethernet driver. This library interacts with FreeRTOS, lwIP TCP/IP stack, Wi-Fi host driver (WHD), and Ethernet driver. It contains the associated code to bind these components together.

*lwIP network interface integration* library is an equivalent of *Wi-Fi middleware core* is now deprecated. *Wi-Fi middleware core* users can use the [porting guide](https://github.com/Infineon/lwip-network-interface-integration/blob/master/porting_guide.md) to migrate the application to use *lwIP network interface integration* library.

## Features and functionality

This library is designed to work with both PSoC&trade; kits with Wi-Fi capability, and XMC&trade; MCU kits with Ethernet capability, and is supported through the ModusToolbox&trade; software environment.

## Log messages

By default, the lwIP network interface integration library disables all debug log messages. Do the following to enable log messages:

1. Add the `ENABLE_CONNECTIVITY_MIDDLEWARE_LOGS` macro to the `DEFINES` in the code example's Makefile. The Makefile entry should look like as follows:
   ```
   DEFINES+=ENABLE_CONNECTIVITY_MIDDLEWARE_LOGS
   ```
2. Call the `cy_log_init()` function provided by the *cy-log* module. cy-log is part of the *connectivity-utilities* library. See [connectivity-utilities library API documentation](https://infineon.github.io/connectivity-utilities/api_reference_manual/html/group__logging__utils.html) for cy-log details.

## Dependencies

The lwIP network interface integration library depends on the following:

- [lwIP FreeRTOS integration](https://github.com/Infineon/lwip-freertos-integration)

- [lwIP](https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip/)

To ensure that all required libraries are fetched, include [ethernet-core-freertos-lwip-mbedtls](https://github.com/Infineon/ethernet-core-freertos-lwip-mbedtls) library depending on the application.

- *For Wi-Fi applications:*

   Create the *wifi-core-freertos-lwip-mbedtls.mtb* file with the following content:

   `https://github.com/Infineon/wifi-core-freertos-lwip-mbedtls#latest-v1.X#\$$ASSET_REPO$$/wifi-core-freertos-lwip-mbedtls/latest-v1.X`

- *For Ethernet applications:*

   Create the *ethernet-core-freertos-lwip-mbedtls.mtb* file with the following content:

   `https://github.com/Infineon/ethernet-core-freertos-lwip-mbedtls#latest-v1.X#\$$ASSET_REPO$$/ethernet-core-freertos-lwip-mbedtls/latest-v1.X`

- Run `make getlibs` to fetch all required libraries including the lwip-network-interface-integration library.
