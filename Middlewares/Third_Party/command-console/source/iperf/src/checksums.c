 *                +---------------- ...
 *
 *
 * Checksum is the 16-bit one's complement of the one's complement sum of a
 * pseudo header of information from the IP header, the UDP header, and the
 * data,  padded  with zero octets  at the end (if  necessary)  to  make  a
 * multiple of two octets.
 *
 * The ipv4 pseudo  header  conceptually prefixed to the UDP header contains the
 * source  address,  the destination  address,  the protocol,  and the  UDP
 * length.   This information gives protection against misrouted datagrams.
 * This checksum procedure is the same as is used in TCP.
 *
 *                 0      7 8     15 16    23 24    31
 *                +--------+--------+--------+--------+
 *                |          source address           |
 *                +--------+--------+--------+--------+
 *                |        destination address        |
 *                +--------+--------+--------+--------+
 *                |  zero  |protocol|   UDP length    |
 *                +--------+--------+--------+--------+
 *
 * If the computed  checksum  is zero,  it is transmitted  as all ones (the
 * equivalent  in one's complement  arithmetic).   An all zero  transmitted
 * checksum  value means that the transmitter  generated  no checksum  (for
 * debugging or for higher level protocols that don't care).
 *
 *
 *  IPV6 Notes:
 *
 *  Any transport or other upper-layer protocol that includes the
 *  addresses from the IP header in its checksum computation must be
 *  modified for use over IPv6, to include the 128-bit IPv6 addresses
 *  instead of 32-bit IPv4 addresses.  In particular, the following
 *  illustration shows the TCP and UDP "pseudo-header" for IPv6:

 *  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 *
 *     o  If the IPv6 packet contains a Routing header, the Destination
 *        Address used in the pseudo-header is that of the final
 *        destination.  At the originating node, that address will be in
 *        the last element of the Routing header; at the recipient(s),
 *        that address will be in the Destination Address field of the
 *        IPv6 header.
 *
 *     o  The Next Header value in the pseudo-header identifies the
 *        upper-layer protocol (e.g., 6 for TCP, or 17 for UDP).  It will
 *        differ from the Next Header value in the IPv6 header if there
 *        are extension headers between the IPv6 header and the upper-
 *        layer header.
 *
 *     o  The Upper-Layer Packet Length in the pseudo-header is the
 *        length of the upper-layer header and data (e.g., TCP header
 *        plus TCP data).  Some upper-layer protocols carry their own
 *        length information (e.g., the Length field in the UDP header);
 *        for such protocols, that is the length used in the pseudo-
 *        header.  Other protocols (such as TCP) do not carry their own
 *        length information, in which case the length used in the
 *        pseudo-header is the Payload Length from the IPv6 header, minus
 *        the length of any extension headers present between the IPv6
 *        header and the upper-layer header.
 *
 *     o  Unlike IPv4, when UDP packets are originated by an IPv6 node,
 *        the UDP checksum is not optional.  That is, whenever
 *        originating a UDP packet, an IPv6 node must compute a UDP
 *        checksum over the packet and the pseudo-header, and, if that
 *        computation yields a result of zero, it must be changed to hex
 *        FFFF for placement in the UDP header.  IPv6 receivers must
 *        discard UDP packets containing a zero checksum, and should log
 *        the error.
 *
 *
 *  Returns zero on checksum success, non zero otherwise
