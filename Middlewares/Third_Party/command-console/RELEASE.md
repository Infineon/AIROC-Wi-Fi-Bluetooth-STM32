# Command console library

## What's included?

See the [README.md](./README.md) for a complete description of the command console library.

## Known issues
| Problem | Workaround |
| ------- | ---------- |
| Running iperf command in client UDP mode with the `-i 1` (interval) option reports a lower throughput. | Run the iPerf without the `-i` (interval) option (or) use an interval value greater than 1 second. |
| IAR 9.30 toolchain throws build errors on Debug mode, if application explicitly includes iar_dlmalloc.h file | Add '--advance-heap' to LDFLAGS in application Makefile. |
