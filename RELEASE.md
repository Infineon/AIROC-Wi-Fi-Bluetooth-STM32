# Infineon AIROC-Wi-Fi-Bluetooth-STM32 Expansion Pack 1.6.1 Release Notes
The Infineon AIROC-Wi-Fi-Bluetooth-STM32 Expansion Pack is an extension of the CMSIS-Pack standard established by Arm.
The pack is compliant with the full CMSIS-Pack standard, with additional requirements/restrictions
on the final pack to meet the STM standard.

This pack uses libraries from the ModusToolbox environment.

## Example apps inside the Pack

### Wi-Fi Scan Example
This example initializes the Wi-Fi device and starts a Wi-Fi scan without any filter and prints the
results on the serial terminal.

Refer to Projects/STM32H747I-DISCO/Applications/wifi_scan/readme.txt for more details

### Wi-Fi Onboarding with Bluetooth LE Example
This example demonstrates a simultaneous usage of Wi-Fi and BLE functionality of CYW43xxx combo
devices. It uses BLE on the combo device to help connect the Wi-Fi to the AP.

Refer to Projects/STM32H747I-DISCO/Applications/ble_wifi_onboarding/readme.txt for more details

### Azure RTOS NetXDuo Wi-Fi UDP echo server
This application provides an example of Azure RTOS/NetXDuo stack usage. It shows how to develop a 
NetX UDP server to communicate with a remote client using the NetX UDP socket API.

### BLE Hello Sensor Example
This code example demonstrates the implementation of a simple Bluetooth Stack functionality in GAP
Peripheral role. During initialization the app registers with LE stack to receive various notifications
including bonding complete, connection status change and peer write.

### Wi-Fi MQTT Client Example
This code example demonstrates implementing an MQTT client using the MQTT library. The library uses
the AWS IoT device SDK Port library and implements the glue layer that is required for the library to
work with Infineon connectivity platforms.
