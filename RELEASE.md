## Example apps inside the Pack

### Wi-Fi Scan Example
This example initializes the Wi-Fi device and starts a Wi-Fi scan without any filter and prints the
results on the serial terminal.

Refer to Projects/STM32H747I-DISCO/Applications/wifi_scan/readme.txt for more details

### Wi-Fi Onboarding with Bluetooth LE Example
This example demonstrates a simultaneous usage of Wi-Fi and BLE functionality of CYW43xxx combo
devices. It uses BLE on the combo device to help connect the Wi-Fi to the AP.

Refer to Projects/STM32H747I-DISCO/Applications/ble_wifi_onboarding/readme.txt for more details

### Azure RTOS NetXDuo Wi-Fi UDP echo server
This application provides an example of Azure RTOS/NetXDuo stack usage. It shows how to develop a 
NetX UDP server to communicate with a remote client using the NetX UDP socket API.
