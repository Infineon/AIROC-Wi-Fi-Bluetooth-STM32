The STM32 Connectivity Expansion Pack is an extension of the CMSIS-Pack standard established by Arm.
The pack is compliant with the full CMSIS-Pack standard, with additional requirements/restrictions
on the final pack to meet the STM standard.

This pack uses libraries from the ModusToolbox environment.

## What's Included?
* BLE/BT Support Release

## What Changed?

 v1.1.0
* Added BLE/BT support
* BLE/BT with WiFi combo usage
* WiFi onboarding with BLE Code Example added
* WiFi connectivity assets have versions promoted
* PAL improvements and fixes

## Supported STM32 Boards and MCU
*  STM32H747I-DISCO Discovery kit and STM32H7xx

## Supported Connectivity Modules

Infineon's CYW43xxx Wi-Fi-BT combo chip family:
* CYW43012
* CYW43439 / CYW4343W / CYW43438
* CYW4373  / CYW4373E

## Example apps inside the Pack

### Wi-Fi Scan Example
This example initializes the Wi-Fi device and starts a Wi-Fi scan without any filter and prints the
results on the serial terminal.

Refer to Projects/STM32H747I-DISCO/Applications/wifi_scan/readme.txt for more details

### Wi-Fi Onboarding with Bluetooth LE Example
This example demonstrates a simultaneous usage of Wi-Fi and BLE functionality of CYW43xxx combo
devices. It uses BLE on the combo device to help connect the Wi-Fi to the AP.
